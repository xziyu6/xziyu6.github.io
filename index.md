Welcome to my blog page (under construction)

I'm a freshmen studying Computer Science at UCSB

Some projects I've been working on recently:

- [Gold Additions](https://github.com/xziyu6/gold-additions): A Chrome extension that can download your course schedule and other stuff as an ICS file, which you can import into Google Calendar / Apple Calendar

- Some mods for Victoria 3 (I have more ideas but I don't think Paradox provided the APIs so this is probably the end of my modding):  
[Basic Food Company Extended](https://github.com/xziyu6/basic-food-company-extended)  
[Better Subject Management](https://github.com/xziyu6/better-subject-management)  
[Consolidate Subjects (Revised)](https://github.com/xziyu6/consolidate-subjects-revised)
